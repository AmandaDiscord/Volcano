# Plugins
Volcano has support for plugins developers can use to add functionality similar to LavaLink. The functionality plugins can offer are a little limited, but the API will expand in the future. Should your plugin require special functionality, please open an issue and I can see on expanding on the API.

## Plugins Volcano supports currently
- Spotify (built in) by PapiOphidian (that's me!)

## Contributing
If you'd like to add your own plugin here for discoverability, you may do so with a PR or issue. I'll be checking code quality, so nothing malicious >:(
